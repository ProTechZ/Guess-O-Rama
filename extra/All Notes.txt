tutorial on startup
tutorial in general


CCE = candy crush effect = make that particular object feel more gamey by applying all relevant candy crush notes
CGN = computer generated number = the number that the computer will generate which the user has to guess

make the thing look more gamey
background like Candy Crush
audio sounds for buttons, animations (rive),
less of a utility-banking app and more of a game app
hot/cold - make the "hot/cold" like shake and vibrate when it comes on the screen
like BIGGER VIBRATION, LESS BIG VIBRATION, SMALL VIBRATION, STILL
maybe make the colours colder and hotter to go with the hot/cold
maybe make icicles form on top and flames come up from bottom respectively and like the blue blur come in from sides and the red blur too 
maybe a potential shop where u can buy stuff with ur stars like -1 guess (to increase ur stars) 
might have lives (probably not)
profiles?

so like homescreen will have the CCE and play button
when u get into play

CANDY CRUSH NOTES
Interesting visual Title
Rope hanging up the title/logo - makes a good effect and adds to the cardboard feel of the logo/title
title in home screen = logo of the game
title/logo gives a feel (cardboardy)
the title can be seen Visually above the background
appbar shape is different

The background is behind everything and that can be seen visually by the background being cut off by the title (like the clouds) or the buttons (the mountain)
character is like a mascot and a noticeable/rememberable thing of the game

button is visually pleasing by having that nice shadow and a fancy font
not saying that you need these things to make a nice button but they add to create a nice effect

all colours match up with the candy feel

gonna be like a "coolmathgames.com (not really but kind of)" or "the wood puzzle game on mum's phone" kinda thing
in the sense its not a game like brawl stars or clash of clans but it is a simple fun game like wood puzzle
two versions based on how u r awarded stars - |time| and |number of guesses (potential shorter term for this = trials?)|
