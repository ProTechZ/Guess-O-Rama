background home screen

candy crush effect on everything - this might mean like everything scratchy and broken as my theme like for sidedrawer and button

gonna be like a "coolmathgames.com (not really but kind of)" or "the wood puzzle game on mum's phone" kinda thing

CANDY CRUSH NOTES
Interesting visual Title
Rope hanging up the title/logo - makes a good effect and adds to the cardboard feel of the logo/title
title in home screen = logo of the game
title/logo gives a feel (cardboardy)
the title can be seen Visually above the background
The background is behind everything and that can be seen visually by the background being cut off by the title (like the clouds) or the buttons (the mountain)
character is like a mascot and a noticeable/rememberable thing of the game
button is visually pleasing by having that nice shadow and a fancy font
not saying that you need these things to make a nice button but they add to create a nice effect
all colours match up with the candy feel
