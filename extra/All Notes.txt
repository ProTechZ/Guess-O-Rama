CCE = candy crush effect = make that particular object feel more gamey by applying all relevant candy crush notes
CGN = computer generated number = the number that the computer will generate which the user has to guess

make the thing look more gamey
background like Candy Crush
audio sounds for buttons, animations (rive),
less of a utility-banking app and more of a game app
hot/cold - make the "hot/cold" like shake and vibrate when it comes on the screen
like BIGGER VIBRATION, LESS BIG VIBRATION, SMALL VIBRATION, STILL
maybe make the colours colder and hotter to go with the hot/cold
maybe make icicles form on top and flames come up from bottom respectively and like the blue blur come in from sides and the red blur too 
maybe a potential shop where u can buy stuff with ur stars like -1 guess (to increase ur stars) 
might have lives (probably not)
profiles?

so like homescreen will have the CCE and play button
when u get into play

CANDY CRUSH NOTES
Interesting visual Title
Rope hanging up the title/logo - makes a good effect and adds to the cardboard feel of the logo/title
title in home screen = logo of the game
title/logo gives a feel (cardboardy)
the title can be seen Visually above the background

The background is behind everything and that can be seen visually by the background being cut off by the title (like the clouds) or the buttons (the mountain)
character is like a mascot and a noticeable/rememberable thing of the game

button is visually pleasing by having that nice shadow and a fancy font
not saying that you need these things to make a nice button but they add to create a nice effect

all colours match up with the candy feel

how the game works:
there are a few things i want to happen only when they install the app but idk if i can do that so if i cant we can js work smthing around
like for e.g. the tutorial, limit of CGN

         | only when they install the app     | if i cant do that  |
_________|____________________________________|____________________|
         | show the tutorial and then show    | might have to make |
         | close button and tell them that    | tutorial a main/   |  possible solution to the "if i cant do it":
tutorial | if they every wanna run the        | prominent button   |  see if provider state stuff can handle and remember the state of "i have seen the tutorial" and what their limit is
	 | tutorial again they can find it    | like in raj's num  |  if not see if firebase can do smthing like that and if i can use firebase
         | in menu                            | pred               |
_________|____________________________________|____________________|  
         | show the input, since the tutorial | might have to ask  |
         | should have explained about the    | at each game       | 
CGN      | limit. then tell them they can     | what there limit   | 
	 | always change the limit if they    | like in raj's num  |
         | want (same place as tutorial)      | pred               |

gonna be like a "coolmathgames.com (not really but kind of)" or "the wood puzzle game on mum's phone" kinda thing
in the sense its not a game like brawl stars or clash of clans but it is a simple fun game like wood puzzle
two versions based on how u r awarded stars - |time| and |number of guesses (potential shorter term for this = trials?)|

both are gonna be like the computer will make its CGN and the user's limit will also be shown
now i have to try and guess the CGN
if i am close to the number it says [boiling, smoking, hot, warm] in the degree of closeness
if i am far from the number it says [freezing, frosty, chilly, cold]
if u played trials, the number of stars u get is determined by how big ur limit was and how many tries u took
if u played time, the number of stars u get is determined by how big ur limit was and how much time u took

the farness and closeness could maybe be showed in like one of those info buttons with 2 info buttons at opposite ends of the screen
and when u hover over the info buttons it can show either a gas fuel thing with that needle for the temperature 
or like the upside down triangle with the colours going from blue to white or red to yellow 
and somehow by hovering over the "freezing" (or instead the description is js alr there) it tells u how far away u r from the CGN

blueredblueredblueredbluered  Freezing
   lightbluelightredligh
     heldjflkdjaksfdjs        Frosty
      fkdajfkdlalsf 
        fdkjaflsd            Chilly
          dkfald 
            kd               Cold


the way it is decided if u get "freezing" or "chilly" is u take half of the limit and u divide it by 4
lets say the user says his limit is 1-100
so divide by 2 thats 50
50 / 4 = 12.5 therefore

37.5-50 = cold -> 38-50 = cold                one prominent issue is concerning the rounding
25-37.5 = chilly -> 25-38 = chilly            for 2 seperate temperatues, there ranges go the the same number (38-50 & 25-38)           
12.5-25 = frosty -> 13-25 = frosty            this is issue as if the user guesses 38 what temperatur would it say
1-12.5 = freezing -> 1-13 = freezing          fix this by knowing when to round up and down but idk how im going to do that
